It should be noted that some of the form actions and calendar interactivity don't completely work.
Most of these actions have been plumbed to loop back or throw alert messages to provide a level of continuity.
The reason for this, is that this website is not hosted on an actual server somewhere with an attached
database that would allow for persistent storage. All links thus should work, but maybe not as they would
given a complete deployment and plumbing to and from a database.
